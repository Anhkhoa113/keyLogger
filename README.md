# keyLogger
A simple keylogger for Windows. 

## Installation & Usage
All you have to do is to run the .py script once and the script will automatically start itself when the pc gets turned on monitoring <br> 
every input from the user's keyboard.
Everytime the file containing the logs exceeds 1mb in size, it will be sent to you via email and deleted on the machine where it is being run.
